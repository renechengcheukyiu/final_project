# J124 Data Journalism - final project by Rene Cheng
## Drug Use By Age (From 12 to 65+ years old) 
### Children as young as 12 has been exposed to drugs and alcohol 


In this project, I investigated the data set of drug use by age from [Fivethirtyeight Github Respository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/drug-use-by-age). The data was used to investigate the story behind "How Baby Boomers Get High". It contains 13 drug uses from across 17 ages, range from as young as 12 years old up to 65+ years old. All the data and sources can be found from: [National Survey on Drug Use and Health from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Data Archive](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/SAMHDA/index.html)


In order to get this data and convert into a usable format, I will have to download the raw dataset from the Fivethirtyeight Github Respository, and ensure I download a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file. This way, I will be able to look at the data in details in Google Sheets to create pivot tables and graphs. In terms of cleaning the data set, I did not have to do much as the data set was already cleaned before I downloaded it. 

Here is the following steps I used to question my data set: 
1. Download .csv file from Github 
2. Upload data set onto Google Sheets 
3. Look at what was interesting about the data set 
4. Separate "Percentage of drug-use" and "Drug-use Frequency" columns for a more viusal view
5. Choose the certain drugs I found interesting and delete the rest 
6. Ask my data set questions 

In this data set, there are 13 drugs reported, however, I am only choosing two of the drugs from all ages. I will be focusing on the drugs: cocaine and marijuana. Also, each age group has a sample size at around 2000+, I multipled the number of people who are sampled by the percentage to see what is the number of people who has in contact to this drug. 

Here is the formula I used: 
```=Sample Size*(Percentage/100) 
````
Example: 
In age 12, there are 2798 individuals in the sample size. There are 1.1% of this age group have contact with marijuana. In order to find the number of people who has contact with marijuana. I used this formula: 
``` =2798*(1.1/100)
```
